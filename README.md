# TRANSACTION ALGORITHM WITH ROLLBACK FEATURE


## Introduction
This is a simple transaction algorithm with rollback feature. The algorithm is implemented in Typescript. The algorithm is implemented in a class called `Transaction`. The class has the following methods:


1. `__init__(self)`: Initializes the transaction object.
2. `begin(self)`: Begins the transaction.
3. `commit(self)`: Commits the transaction.
4. `rollback(self)`: Rolls back the transaction.
